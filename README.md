# Seattle_911_Analysis
In this data set, the city of Seattle only receives 911 calls for four reasons - a hot latte spills all over your lap (ouch!), Beavers attack unsuspecting passersbys (watch out for those beavers!), Seal attacks (can't be too careful), and Marshawn Lynch sightings (people get very excited and choose to call 911 for some reason).
